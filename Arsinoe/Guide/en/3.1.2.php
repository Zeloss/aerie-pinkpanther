<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Context</span> :<br />
Goddess Danifae no longer meets the prayers, secret caves to worship her triplets's cave are invaded by monsters and you just saved their souls. It starts to become really strange ...</ p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Progress</span> :</p>

<p>1- Julian the Apostate allows you to visit the main temple dedicated to Goddess Danifae. Once granted access to Arsinoe in your pocket, go to the temple. [ars_fild22,240,299] The Prelate Anthiole speaks about another worrying disappearance, that of the Prophet Tzangue which has a very special bond with the divine. According to the prelate, he was sighted the last time by the Mage Gawell in Bacchias Mountains. </ p>

<p>2- Return to the Boatman of the Citadel of Light. He will offer a crossing to the temple of solitude but for 600 Silver Coins! You are unfortunately unable to refuse the offer. </ p>

<p>3- You are! And what luck, you see the Prophet Tzangue at the entrance of the Temple. When you tell him that you got the souls of the triplets, he turns into joy and offers to go with him to preach good news to the Goddess Danifae. Alas once inside it started to feel bad, feel evil forces. Indeed we will have to fight once more to eliminate the demon who holds the Temple. </ p>

<p>4- Tzangue and Danifae Goddness appear on the death of the monster near the altar of the Temple. Danifae explains why she couldn't answer the prayers of the faithful because his children had been stolen by Gayzor, the demon that you just removed. A portal will appear, engulfing you in, you'll be teleported to the village of Crystalmir. </ p>
